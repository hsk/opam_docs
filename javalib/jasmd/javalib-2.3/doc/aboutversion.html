<h2>About this Version</h2>
<p>
The version 2.3 is a minor release which adds genericMap and genericSet. This is
a facility over ptrees, allowing more easily to create Map and Set, simply by
specifying how to obtain a hash function.
The version 2.2.1 adds some utility functions and fixes minor bugs.
The version 2.2 adds support for the attribute
LocalVariableTypeTable which is the LocalVariableTable for generics
added in Java 5. It also fixes some minor bugs detailled in the
CHANGELOG file (Caution: string output of function JPrint.class_name
with option ~jvm:true has changed).
